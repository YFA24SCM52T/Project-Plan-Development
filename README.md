# **University Application Portal Planning Agents (AutoGen + LangChain)**

This project simulates a multi-agent system using AutoGen and LangChain to collaboratively build a detailed project plan for a university application portal. Each agent represents a different role in software and academic operations, estimating the effort needed per project phase with logic-driven reasoning and LLM support.

## Project Objective:
  To design and plan a comprehensive university application portal enabling:

    Student registration and account management
    Program application and document upload
    Real-time application tracking and notifications
    Integration with:
    University Student Management System (SMS)
    Canvas LMS (for courses and assignments)
    Library access and Financial Aid systems

## Key Features
    Multi-role ConversableAgents (AutoGen) for end-to-end software lifecycle planning
    LangChain for memory-enabled, prompt-driven agent reasoning and coordination
    Effort estimation logic based on agent-specific productivity models
    Structured communication through a GroupChatManager simulating a Waterfall methodology

## Technologies Used
    AutoGen
    LangChain
    OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
    Python 3.10+
    Docker (suggested)


## How to Run?
    Make sure your environment is configured with openai and langchain
